    Our aim is to compare neuroexcitability against Coke energy, Coke classic and water. Our hypothesis is that neuroexcitability will be significantly lower in Coke energy than in Coke classic and these two will have lower excitability than water. Additionally, excitability in the M1 will be lower than in the vertex.")
